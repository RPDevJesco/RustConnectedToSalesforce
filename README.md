# RustConnectedToSalesforce

This is a basic implementation example of how to connect to Salesforce from a Rust application.

In order to use this, you need to update the auth_url to be set to the correct URL for your Salesforce instance.

You will also need to fill in the details for:
client_id
client_secret
username
password

Once the information has been plugged in correctly, you should get a similar console output as the image below.
